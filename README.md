# Home Assistant Tapo Integration

This is a custom integration to control Tapo devices from home assistant.

The core of the integration is provied by [plugp100](https://github.com/petretiandrea/plugp100) python library based on work of [@K4CZP3R](https://github.com/K4CZP3R/tapo-p100-python).

## Warning!!!
Although the integration works using LAN, the tapo device needs internet access to synchronize with tapo cloud, especially for credentials, a missing internet access could lead into "Invalida authentication error". Also a static IP must be set for device.

## Warning!!!
For some unknown reason email with capital letter thrown an "Invalid authentication" error. So before open an new issue check your email address on Tapo App Settings. If contains capital letter, the integration won't work. I've opened an issue that explain this [#122](https://github.com/petretiandrea/home-assistant-tapo-p100/issues/122), I will fix asap. As workaround you can create a new account using all lower-case in your email address.

# How to install

## Simplest and recomended way
This integration is part of HACS store, so you don't need anymore to add this repository as a custom repository.
You can find it directly on HACS Store: search for `tapo` and you will find `Tapo Controller`. (**HACS >= 1.6.0 is required**)

## Old way as a custom repository (not recomended, but use if you want to use beta versions)
1. Install from HACS, add this repository as custom repository
2. Search into HACS store the tapo integration and install
3. Full restart of home assistant is recomended

This video show installation steps:

[![Install Steps](http://img.youtube.com/vi/KSYldphgE5A/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/KSYldphgE5A)

## "Manual" way
1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `tapo`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/tapo/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "tapo"


# How to add a Tapo device (after installing the integration)
## Using UI

1. Be sure the integration is installed successfully
2. Go to integrations menu
3. Search for `Tapo` integration
4. Insert host (ip address), username and password for control your tapo device (the same used for tapo app).
   If you have a problem in this phase, like "invalid auth" error, please see [#122](https://github.com/petretiandrea/home-assistant-tapo-p100/issues/122), and if error persist write a comment in the same issue
5. Wait for connection. It automatically recognize if the tapo device is switch or light or something else :)
<!---->

## Configuration by configuration.yaml
Domain can be `switch`, `light` or `sensor`.

An example with switch:
```yaml
switch:
  platform: tapo
  host: ...
  username: ...
  password: ...
```
